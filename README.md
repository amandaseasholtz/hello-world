# hello-world

Hi fellow CS peeps, 
My name is Amanda (aka. Mandy). I am a beggining computer science student (sophomore). I haven't always been a CS student though; I was first an art major actually! When I learned that my creaivity could be combined with computing, I was sold! I have enjoyed the journey thus far. 

p.s. My favorite food is beef jerky (and definitely not  chocolate! lol )
